    "### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Supervised Learning is used when the dataset contains labels (correct answers). The model learns from input-output pairs and tries to predict the correct output for new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  \n",
    "- Spam Email Detection  \n",
    "- House Price Prediction  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Unsupervised Learning is used when the dataset has no labels. The model explores the data and finds hidden patterns, relationships, or clusters on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  \n",
    "- Customer Segmentation  \n",
    "- Grouping Similar News Articles  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. The goal is to maximize rewards over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  \n",
    "- AI Playing Chess  \n",
    "- Robot Learning to Walk  \n",

    "| Spam Detection                | Supervised Learning   | Has labeled data (spam/not spam) |\n",
    "| House Price Prediction        | Supervised Learning   | Has actual price values as labels |\n",
    "| Customer Segmentation         | Unsupervised Learning | No labels; finding hidden groups |\n",
    "| News Article Clustering       | Unsupervised Learning | Detecting natural groupings |\n",
    "| AI Playing Chess              | Reinforcement Learning| Learns from rewards/penalties |\n",
    "| Robot Navigation              | Reinforcement Learning| Improves actions via feedback |\n",

    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Choosing the wrong learning type is a common beginner mistake. If you pick the wrong framework, your model will struggle or completely fail before you even start coding."
